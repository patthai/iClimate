iClimate : A Platform for Collecting  Public Imagination on Climate Change.
This proposal aim to demonstrate a novel method to engage the climate modeling with public using “speculative design”.  By creating scenarios around these “what if” questions with tangible and realistic information, the platform can fabricate experiences of that possible future. The architecture of this platform will have 3 parts. The first part is the interface that allow the audience to pick the location that they want to explore. After that the system will take real information from database to generate different futuristic dystopia and utopia scenarios for that selected location. The platform will ask the audience to use the generated scenario as a premise to complete a story that they imagine might happen after they see the real data and the premise. By doing this, the climate information can provoke public’s imagination that can be a call to action or the starting point for more investigation.
